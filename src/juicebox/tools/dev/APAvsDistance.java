/**
 * Created by muhammadsaadshamim on 1/19/16.
 * <p/>
 * Except for superloops, we don't observe long-range loops. Why not?
 * <p/>
 * The first possibility is that long-range loops do not form, either because:
 * <p/>
 * a) there is some mechanism that creates a hard cap on the length of loops,
 * such as the processivity of the excom, or
 * <p/>
 * b) given a convergent pair A/B separated by >2Mb,
 * there are too many competing ctcf motifs in between.
 * <p/>
 * Alternatively, loops do form between pairs of convergent CTCF sites that are far apart,
 * but those loops are too weak for us to see in our maps.
 * <p/>
 * A simple way to probe this is to do APA. Bin pairs of convergent loop anchors by 1d distance,
 * and then do APA on the pairs in each bin. You should get a strong apa score at 300kb.
 * what about 3mb? 30mb?
